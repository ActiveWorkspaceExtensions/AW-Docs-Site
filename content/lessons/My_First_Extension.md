title: "My First Active Workspace Extension"
---

Active Workspace is a Teamcenter Client that utilizes web technologies like node.js, angularjs and others to meet the needs of many engineering, manufacturing and other systems around the world.  With these technologies na modern web development we can extend the Active Workspace to automate tasks on the client or display data a certain way.

To get started with this walkthrough make sure your [environment is setup](https://activeworkspaceextensions.github.io/environment-setup), and if you were able to have [express running](https://activeworkspaceextensions.github.io/express-setup).

There are a few ways to create an extension within Active Workspace.  For this tutorial however we will go over the generator that comes with the client and how to generate a tools and info panel.

Initialize the environment with initenv.cmd, this is located directly inside the Stage directory


```javascript
makeArray() {
    // Hey hey what can I do
    const foo = []
    bar.split('').forEach(letter => {
      foo.push(letter)
    })
    return foo
}
```
